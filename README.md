Localisation
============

This package helps to setup translations and implementations for given models, entities, collections or anything else. If you know to write a class to extend libraries, you can translate practically anything.

The Localisation package in reality is a very basic package, simply defining the APIs and interfaces necessary for implementing translation components.
